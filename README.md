* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project three, is all about making a function that pulls data, while also giving the user the nessary information for inventory purposes. The problem that we are trying to solve would be allow us to pull different sections for each different product. This also puts each inventory item chronological order.

* What did you do particularly well?
I believe what I did well was the formating the code, in easy to read along with the UI interface. While making sure that there are no issues with the code while making sure that it was also easy to follow.
* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I would like to enhance the structure of my code a little more, while it is clean and easy to follow but I could have made even better.

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I would say the hardest part of my code, was to get the UI just right, while it may seem easy for some people but I was stuggling with it for some reason. Another thing that I got stuck on was linking the orginal inventory file and making sure everything showed up perfectly. I did use Khan Acedemy for some of my resources, along with YouTube to help me walk through somethings that I could be missing.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Some of the skills that transfered well was having the ability to have the UI be customizable to each different project that requires them. 
* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I took alot of my time to be able to make sure that it would be easy to follow and put myself into the shoes of someone who is looking at code for the first time. This allowed me to have the adaptibility for my code which caused it easy to read along.
